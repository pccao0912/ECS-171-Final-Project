## Abstract
The daataset we are using records the standardzed test scores of high school students in the United States in various subjects,  and some personal identification details. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

In this project, we would like to use this data to to understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation, and other factors on a student's performance on high school standardized tests in order to create a model to predict how well students will do this year. Additionaly, this will help us gain a better understanding as to why admissions officers argued standardized testing isn't a fair measure of admissions.
